Yes or no?

Yes, Magzhan's explanations during office hours helped to grasp the idea.

Yes or no?

At first, all my planets appeared at the same spot, center. I solved that by creating a separate loop for them. Then my planets went up and right. I reread the instructions again and added the step where fx and fy are initialized to 0 at each time step. My animation finally worked fine but my numbers are little off. I read the debugging part and I double-checked I have separate loops for steps 5A 5B 5C and my velocities are updated before positions.

It was actually great seeing the animation. It's amazing that we only wrote the laws of physics and the code produced something beautiful. But, I don't think I enjoyed the project much overall. All the steps until 5A, 5B, 5C were just following instructions. And the those last 3 steps are very confusing. And it wasn't because my coding skills are not good enough, I just don't know physics) that was a bummer.
